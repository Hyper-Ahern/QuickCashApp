# Quick Cash App

Project for CSCI 3130 - Software development

I led a team of 7 people and interacted with a teaching assistant who acted as a client for our group to simulate real world development. 

The app was built in android studio and allows a user to view or create job posts then accept a job or hire someone for theirs.

It allows payment through the PayPal API and credit card authentication

It also uses Google Map API for location services.

This is the culmination of 3 months of work and many late nights.
